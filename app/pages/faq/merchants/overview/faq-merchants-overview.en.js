          GoCardless is great for many use cases. However, there are some limitations with our service. We aren't able to:
        </p>
        <ul className='list'>
          <li>
            <strong>Let you take credit card payments</strong> - however you <strong>can</strong> use
            another payment provider alongside GoCardless.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Let you accept instant payments</strong> - Direct Debit payments take 3-5 working
            days to clear, so they're not ideal for goods that need to be shipped quickly.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className='para'>
          We're able to accept most kinds of customers but there are some exceptions - for
