          We're building a simple, intuitive system on top of the world's broken payments
          infrastructure. To do this, we're constantly tackling interesting problems

            AngularJS style guide
          </a> and <a href='https://github.com/gocardless/http-api-design'>HTTP API Design Guidelines</a>,

          our <a href='https://gocardless.com/blog/tagged/engineering'>

          represented at events attracting great software engineers and designers, and
          that they know we're hiring.
